About Me

As a seasoned Product Manager with over 15 years of experience, I specialize in driving scalable, AI-powered solutions that deliver measurable impact across diverse industries, including banking, healthcare, and technology. With a deep technical foundation and a strategic mindset, I have successfully led the development of high-performance data platforms and AI/ML-driven products, from concept to execution.

Over the past 3 years, I’ve focused on leading AI/ML and data-driven product initiatives, leveraging my expertise in data platforms (Snowflake, Databricks), machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning to build products that transform business outcomes. Whether leading teams to implement real-time fraud detection systems or developing cutting-edge solutions for data management, I am driven by the challenge of solving complex problems with impactful, innovative products. My experience spans product vision, strategic planning, and execution—working closely with cross-functional teams to define product roadmaps, align business goals with technical capabilities, and ensure successful delivery. I am particularly adept at translating complex technical requirements into clear business objectives and communicating these to stakeholders at all levels.

A key part of my success lies in my ability to balance the technical and business aspects of product development. I am proficient in agile methodologies, product lifecycle management, and data governance, with a sharp focus on improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. I have consistently optimized product performance, ensuring solutions meet evolving market needs while adhering to stringent regulatory and compliance standards such as GDPR, CCPA, and AML/KYC.

I thrive in environments that challenge me to grow, whether by optimizing AI models, scaling products, or leading cross-functional teams to execute strategic initiatives. Passionate about leveraging AI and data to solve real-world problems, I am committed to driving innovation and creating value through thoughtful product development.
